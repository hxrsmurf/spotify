# spotify

This is a basic PowerShell to control Spotify's Player and get top track/artist report.

The functions...don't work, so keep that in mind.

Load PowerShell:

```
. .\spotify.ps1
```

1. Authorization
2. Paste in web browser
3. Get token (grab from after access_token to &token_type)
	- https://hxrsmurf.info/#access_token=MYTOKEN&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=3600
	- MYTOKEN
4. player MYTOKEN 100
	- 100 is the volume
